This project, in cooperation with NTT DATA, is concerned with helping an e-commerce company in its business decisions. The data was provided by NTT DATA. An RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis was carried out, followed by clustering based on K-Means to make a customer segmentation. Then a reccomendation system was created to recommend the right product to the right customer, using the TuriCreate library. Finally, different algorithms were implemented to predict with the highest possible level of accuracy the error in days of the arrival date of a product shipment. Further information can be found in our [presentation](project_presentation.pdf).
